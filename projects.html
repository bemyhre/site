	    	<p>
            I have written a <a href="https://github.com/bemyhre/craigslist-recentjobsearch-multilocation">Ruby application that scours Craigslist Jobs by search term with multiple locations</a> to return listing sorted by listing dates. My intent for this was to provide a personal means to find jobs that have been listed recently across multiple locations. If I find it first.... I can apply first!

	    	One day the name "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1479129836/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1479129836&linkCode=as2&tag=gugogr-20">Fifty Shades of Bacon</a>" popped into my head. By the end of that day, I decided I was going to make it. I called up my friend <a href="http://www.recipe-diaries.com/">Jenna Johnson</a> and from there we were unstoppable. We collaborated, along with some other very talented people, to create this book that has been sold all around the world, been featured in Allure Magazine, Seattle Kitchen radio and many other popular websites (my personal favorite being <a href="http://theworstthingsforsale.com/2013/09/22/fifty-shades-of-bacon/">The Worst Things for Sale</a>).
	    	<br><br>

	    	Since Fifty Shades of Bacon did so well, my wife and I followed up with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1481148583/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1481148583&linkCode=as2&tag=gugogr-20">Chocogasms</a>, which allowed us to keep along the same lines of erotic cookery and explore a sweeter shade of opulant extravagance.
	    	<br><br>

	    	One of the coolest things about writing these books is that I have been able to help other people realize thier publishing dreams by sharing my experience with them. While I may not have been the source of people's stories or the motivation to do the writing, I have helped people navigate the self publishing world and I like to think that I may have been the spark of a few published books.

	  		<h2>Blogs and Websites</h2>
            <p>
            I have been interested in blogging and websites for quite a while. Using the Wordpress platform (and some exploration into Drupal and Joomla), I have been able to create several blogs and websites over the years. I currently host the landing pages for <a href="http://www.fiftyshadesofbacon.com">Fifty Shades of Bacon</a> and <a href="http://www.chocogasms.com">Chocogasms</a> on Wordpress instances. In addition, I have maintained <a href="http://www.guygoesgreen.com">Guy Goes Green</a>, <a href="http://www.brewthismovie.com">Brew this Movie</a> and other historical sites using Wordpress. 

            <br><br>

            I have also provided content for <a href="http://www.pricingresearchonline.com/">Get4It.com</a>

            <br><br>

            Like with my book, one of the really fun things about having this skillset, is that I have helped others set up thier own websites and blogs using the Wordpress platform. I really enjoy being able to help other people succeed, so sharing this knowledge with others so that THEY can realize thier aspirations has really been inspiring to me.
