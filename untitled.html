    One day the name "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fifty-Shades-Bacon-Benjamin-Myhre/dp/1479129836/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1365518961&sr=8-1&keywords=fifty+shades+of+bacon">Fifty Shades of Bacon</a>" popped into my head. By the end of that day, I decided I was going to make it. I called up my friend <a href="http://www.recipe-diaries.com/">Jenna Johnson</a> and from there we were unstoppable. We collaborated, along with some other very talented people, to create this book that has been sold all around the world, been featured in Allure Magazine, Seattle Kitchen radio and many other popular websites (my personal favorite being <a href="http://theworstthingsforsale.com/2013/09/22/fifty-shades-of-bacon/">The Worst Things for Sale</a>).
